# video-game-recommendation-system
This is a content based recommendation system for video games. 
The recommendation system compares sales and review metrics of different video games to
recommend video games to the user based on a video game title which they select.
The webpage uses information from a database hosted on Kaggle. 
This is the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings
Parts of the HTML and Javascript page use generated content from Python scripts which I wrote.
